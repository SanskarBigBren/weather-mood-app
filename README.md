##  How It Works  
1. User searches for a city  
2. App fetches live weather data using **OpenWeather API**  
3. Based on the weather (Sunny, Rainy, Snowy, etc.):  
   - A random **song** starts playing  
   - A new **quote** and **recipe** are shown  
   - The **background & mood image** update accordingly  
4. When the song ends, a new **song, quote, and recipe** are generated automatically
